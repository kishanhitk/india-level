# Map Levels
Mark your footprint on the map.


Checkout: https://india-level.kishans.in/


## How to Use

Tap and mark states or union territories terretories you've been to. Tap "Save" to save it as image and share your progress.

## Disclaimer

States potrayed in the maps are highly abstracted. 

Definitions of levels are deliberately not specified. Please use at your own discretion. I'd only suggest "higher the points, higher the 'involvements' you have for that place".

Please feel free to create other versions using this code, so long as they are released under the same license. I do not have future plans on creating new versions, as my knowledge in other regions might not be sufficient for me to do so.

The name initials are removed in the India version, as Indian map is too complex to fit the initials.
